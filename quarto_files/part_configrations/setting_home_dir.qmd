title: "Setting up your $HOME Variable on Windows 10"

## Overview

For some workstations at VI the home directory is configured on a so-called 
`H:\` drive. This causes a failure when trying to generate a new `SSH` key 
which is something you will need if you [work with GitHub](/quarto_files/part_configurations/connecting_r_studio_to_github.qmd).

For this reason you will need to change the $HOME directory variable to point 
to the `C:\Users\` directory.

## Steps

1. From the Start menu, enter env to display the Environment Variables window.
If your system is in the Norwegian language, use the search term "milj√∏" instead.

2. Enter a new $HOME variable for your account:

    - Click New under User variables.
    - Enter HOME for the variable name.
    - Enter C:\Users\username for the variable value, where username is your VI Number.
    - Click OK.
    
After completing this, you should be able to create a new SSH in Git Bash 
as described above without any issues.
